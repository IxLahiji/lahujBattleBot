# lahujBattleBot

This project is a bot to manage battling between users in discord servers, created using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) discord API wrapper. This code is being developed in Python 3.5, and is incompatible with previous versions of Python.

## To-do:
  
* 

## Installation:

To install the required prerequisites, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Setup:

1. Provide the bot with your discord bot account's token:
  
  a. Obtain your discord bot's token. This is done by going to your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). Login and then select the application you wish to grab the token for. Once there, click on "click to reveal" next to "Token". If you have not already created an application, click on "New Application" after logging in. Once you have created an application, a bot user can be added to your application by clicking on "Create a Bot User".

  b. When the application starts for the first time, it will generate a settings.JSON file, and terminate. In order to use the bot, modify the value for the discord_token entry to include your bot accounts' token as obtained from step (a). Running the bot without including a valid token will result in errors.
